**Journey**

I was preparing for Pre-medical exams. It was my second attempt and i was very sure that i am not going to make it. My friend and room-mate Vinod was
not in any different situation than me. One evening he suggested, Let's do BCA (Bachelors of Computer Applications). It was 
a bachelors course famous among those who just wanted to do something to complete their graduation so i just said, are you kidding me?
It is nowhere related medical/biology stream. He said, he is serious that it presents good opportunity to learn
about computers. I didn't take his advice seriously.

We gave that pre-medical exam and as expected very confidently failed it. Now i really had to choose one of three options:
Number one was 3rd attempt for same pre-medical exam (which i really didn't want to do and was very sure that i'll better do some regular 
graduation degree than 3rd attempt). Second option of bachelors in Biotechnology (Deep inside me i was not excited for this option as well).
Third and last option was Vinod's suggestion to consider BCA. I took some good couple of months to decide. I realized i didn't enjoy the biology
stream at all and Bio-technology was going to drag me into next 3 boring years. I had least idea about BCA which sort of ignited the spark of curosity
which i believe is a must if you want to learn technology. So although the course BCA was not one of a very high profile course. It still seamed to promise 
some new stuff to learn.

I remember someone said before I joined my fist class of BCA that if you master one of the programming languages then you are going to go really far.
I didn't know what he meant but, I just remembered the term programming language and thought to certainly make sure i learn it properly.
I missed my first programming class and, I was so worried that I actually went to get the notes to one of my class-mate in the evening.
He shared his notebook and first line of the program threw me off. it was #include stdio.h and i was like what is this all. I am never going to understand this.
This all does not make any sense. I got really worried and, I immediately bought the very famous book for C programming from Balagurusamy.
After some time i realized i got so addicted to this book that I read half of the book in couple of days. I solved all the programmes and i still remember that i 
got this thought inside me that i've chosen the correct path. I can certainly go ahead and make my career in this because i was simply loving solving programmes.
I was not just solving them, i was improvising the problems, making them harder and then solving them.

In first year, I started studying programming books from second year (Java Core). I was scoring good marks in the programming language subject.
To cut-short the story, I eventually did my masters in Advanced Software Engineering from University of Sheffield and finally got a job of Software Engineer and
I was so satisfied with my decision to choose BCA and choosing path to become a Software Engineer. 

**Observations**

When a person from computer science background joins a company as a Software Engineer, he/she learns a lot of things/tools/technologies which were
not even mentioned in academics. you get to see large real life projects composed of thousands of lines packaged in hundreds of packages.
You get to learn tools for building your project (eg: maven or gradle). You get to deal with different coding styles from different developers in past and moreover
you are asked to make changes in them. You are supposed to read complex legacy code and make a tiny/medium or large change into that.
These situations were never present in academics. We just learned programming languages and solved some nowhere close to real life problems.
You need to provide support for production systems. This is nowhere related to programming.

As you can see there is a large gap.

So is software Engineering really not that fun? Yes and No. "Yes" if you only love to solve problems in books. "No" if you love to learn how to build and maintain complex systems.
If you want to solve real life problems the software engineering is a way to go. All the problems i mentioned in first paragraph can be addressed using good engineering practices.
It is not just in theory, large systems like Google, FB are great examples of that.
